# WSL and Parallel MODFLOW

Instructions are provided here for setting up Ubuntu on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to work with MODFLOW.

## 1. Installing WSL
_Note that you need elevated privileges and sometimes your IT administrator to complete this step_

On a Windows machine it is relatively easy to get parallel MODFLOW compiled and running in a WSL Ubuntu virtual machine.

Install a latest version of Ubuntu.
```
  wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

You will be asked to provide a username and password. You'll need to remember this information for some future `sudo` operations. 

Alternatively, you can install Ubuntu-22.04 from the Microsoft Store. In that case, you (or your administrator) might need to activate WSL explicitly:

1.	Open Windows 10 Settings app.
2.	Select Apps.
3.	Click Programs and Features under the Related settings section on the right.
4.	Under the Programs and Features page, click Turn Windows features on or off on the left panel.
5.	Scroll down and enable Windows Subsystem for Linux.


## 2. Clone the class repo

When typing "Ubuntu" in your Windows Search box, the installed version should become visible in the Apps section. Click to start a terminal window.

In the terminal, clone the class repo using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mjr-deltares/parallel-modflow-dsd23.git
```

## 3. Setting up parallel MODFLOW 6 and pixi environment

In order to set up parallel MODFLOW 6,  execute:

```
cd parallel-modflow-dsd23
./pixi run install
```

This will take a bit of time, somewhere in between 15 minutes and an hour. A successful installation sequence concludes with the message:

```
Successful testing of pixi environment and MODFLOW 6
```

## 4. Start Jupyter Lab

Jupyter Lab can be started by executing:

```
./pixi run jupyter
```
and (when using WSL) clicking or copying the link at the end of the message:

```
 To access the server, open this file in a browser:
      file:///home/user/.local/share/jupyter/...
 Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
      http://localhost:8888/lab?token=...
      http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...
```
